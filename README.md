CRUNCHY CORNER SALES DASHBOARD
I recently completed a comprehensive financial analysis and business optimization project for Crunchy Corner, one of india's largest fast food chains,under the guidance of Mohd Kasfur Dhuniyan. Here's a look at what i accomplished:
Project Overview:
Client: Crunchy Corner, serving millions daily!
Objective: Dvelop a PowerBi Dashboard to track financial performance, streamline operations, and enhance budgeting accuracy.
My Contributions:
Data Cleaning and Processing:
Managed two massive datasets: Actual (478,000+ rows)and Budget (48,000+ rows), covering 30+ columns like sales, costs, and profits. 
Ensured data accuracy through extensive cleaning and standardization using Excel.
Financial Performance Analysis:
Analyzed trends in net revenue, gross profit, EBITDA, and PAT percentages to asses profitability. 
Evaluated performance by product category and location, identifying top performers.
Conducted cost analysis and SKU turnover assessments to optimize inventory management. 
Business Optimization:
Created advance visualizations (scatter plots, quadrant analyses) to spotlight top performing product categories.
This Project has not only honed my analytical skills but also deepened my understanding of business optimization in the fast food industry!
A huge thank you to Mohd Kasfur Dhuniyan for invaluable guidance and support throughtout this project!
